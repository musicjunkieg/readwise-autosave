Start a new feature with TDD workflow.

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/$ARGUMENTS`
2. Create test file in appropriate location based on feature
3. Write failing test that describes the expected behavior
4. Run `cargo test` to verify test fails
5. Implement minimal code to make test pass
6. Iterate until feature is complete
7. Run `/commit` when ready
